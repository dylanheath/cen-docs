# ⚙ API Reference

Dive into the specifics of each API endpoint by checking out our complete documentation.

## Transactions

All Transaction data is accessible much like any blockchain, this includes Sender/Receiver information such as Name, Address etc.. , amount , message and timestamp.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="transactions.md" %}
[transactions.md](transactions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Users

View all User data from recent balance history to in & outgoings of their account.

{% content-ref url="users.md" %}
[users.md](users.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Using the 'Page Link' block lets you link directly to a page. If this page's name, URL or parent location changes, the reference will be kept up to date. You can also mention a page – like [transactions.md](transactions.md "mention") – if you don't want a block-level link.
{% endhint %}
